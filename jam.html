    <UL>
        <li>Each group can have maximum up to 2 
        participants.</li> 
        <li> The JAM master has the final say. No questions or 
        arguments once the final decision has been made.</li>
        <li> To object, slam the table and say "JAM". The JAM 
        master decides when you are allowed to put forth 
        your objection.</li>
        <li> You get a penalty if the competition objects on any 
        of the following counts :
        i) You object out of turn.
        ii) You stutter, stammer, and generally indulge in 
        "time wasting tactics". These include efforts to buy 
        time like interspersing your talk "uhh", "aah", etc...
        iii) Early start and late start.
        iv) Speaking too fast or too slow.
        v) Grammatical errors.
        vi) Undue stress on word, undue emphasis in the 
        sentences.
        vii) Repetition of a previously used idea.
        viii) Not following the "random rule" as set by the 
        JAM master. For example, the most popular random 
        rule was "Praise Narendra Modi before objecting". If 
        you forget to do so or the JAM master thinks that the 
        praise was not good enough, you will not be allowed 
        to object and lose points for an incorrect/bad 
        objection.</li>
        <li> The total time is 60 seconds, inclusive of all the 
        time that all the speakers in a given round are 
        allowed to speak.</li>
        <li> Above rules and method play can be changed or 
        modified as per the discretion of the JAM master.</li>
